# Clasification with Naive Bayes

One of the tasks that I accomplished in the data mining lesson from the third grade of the computer science branch at Dokuz eylul University, and the data set was divided into training data and test set
During this task, the following was accomplished:
1- An exploratory analysis of the data
2- Dealing with missing values
3- Checking for outlier values and dealing with them
4- Encoding
5- Create and train the model
6- Create the evaluation function to evaluate the validity of the model using the test data

This task was to consolidate the concepts related to classification and some typical evaluation scales, after several academic lessons during which the Naive bayes algorithm and its mechanism of action were clarified and in these cases it is likely to be used
