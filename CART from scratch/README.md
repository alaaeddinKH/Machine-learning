# Machine Learning Project Report

This project was implemented as part of the Machine Learning course at Dokuz Eyl√ºl University. The project consists of the following files:

1. Dataset: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.
2. Python Code File: This file contains the code written in Python.

## Key Points

1. The code builds a decision tree from scratch for classification and prediction.
2. The Gini impurity measure is used for splitting.
3. Object-oriented programming concepts were employed to create the decision tree, which consists of nodes represented by concepts such as "class" and "object."
4. The code includes functions to preprocess the data before passing it to the decision tree.
5. It also includes a function to measure the test results by comparing the values classified by the decision tree after training with the ground truth values provided in the test data.
6. The program also visualizes the decision tree and exports the visualization as a PDF file.

## Comments on the Results

1. The results are still unsatisfactory, but there are several steps that can be taken to improve the performance, including:
   - Adding parameters to control the depth of the tree.
   - Adding parameters for tree pruning.
   - Working more on data preprocessing.
   - Improving the code overall to enhance performance.
   - Experimenting with common techniques to improve decision tree training.
